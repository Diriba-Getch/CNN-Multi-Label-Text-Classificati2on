"""
Classes for representing and processing probabilistic information.

The ``FreqDist`` class is used to encode "frequency distributions",
which count the number of times that each outcome of an experiment
occurs.

The ``ProbDistI`` class defines a standard interface for "probability
distributions", which encode the probability of each outcome for an
experiment.  There are two types of probability distribution:

  - "derived probability distributions" are created from frequency
    distributions.  They attempt to model the probability distribution
    that generated the frequency distribution.
  - "analytic probability distributions" are created directly from
    parameters (such as variance).

The ``ConditionalFreqDist`` class and ``ConditionalProbDistI`` interface
are used to encode conditional distributions.  Conditional probability
distributions can be derived or analytic; but currently the only
implementation of the ``ConditionalProbDistI`` interface is
``ConditionalProbDist``, a derived distribution.

    A frequency distribution for the outcomes of an experiment.  A
    frequency distribution records the number of times each outcome of
    an experiment has occurred.  For example, a frequency distribution
    could be used to record the frequency of each word type in a
    document.  Formally, a frequency distribution can be defined as a
