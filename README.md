# Convolutional Neural Networks for Multi-Label Text Classification

This project is my research group project, and it is also a study of TensorFlow, Deep Learning(CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.).

The main objective of the project is to solve the multi-label text classification problem.

The project refer to [dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf), make the data helper supports Chinese language (Task required) and modified the network structure (Based on my task).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow 1.0.0 +
- Numpy
- Gensim

## Data

Research data may attract copyright protection under China law. Thus, there is only code.

实验数据属于实验室与某公司的合作项目，涉及商业机密，在此不予提供，还望谅解。

## Pre-trained Word Vectors

Use `gensim` package to pre-train my data.


## Network Structure


## Innovation

1. Make the data support **Chinese** and English.(Which use `gensim` seems easy)
2. Can use **your own pre-trained word vectors**.
3. Add a new **Highway Layer**.
